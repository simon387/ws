#### HUNTING STRATEGY

The Hunting strategy is probably the friendliest for players as, by its nature, it keeps you away from players and instead focuses on taking out NPC troops. The
basic idea here is to stay on the outskirts of the map and defeat Mine Patrols. The key here is to get the right side level 1 skill which will see you earn 1.5K
Orichalcum for each Mine Patrol beaten. Overall, the best skills to pick for this strategy are as follows:

+ Right skill
+ Right skill
+ Left skill
+ Left skill
+ Right skill

#### GATHERING STRATEGY

The Gathering strategy is a bit more relaxing than the Hunting strategy as you can just leave your squads to do their thing at Veins and Vein Outbursts.
However, to rank well with this method things can be difficult as a F2P player. This is because to get the most points you will need to occupy level 3 Veins AND
contest for the Smelter. There will be a lot of other players doing the same thing meaning it is extremely likely you will face several PvP Attacks on your
Veins.

The reality is that people who spend the most money on the game will have better Heroes for defeating yours. Nevertheless, the best Skills for the Gathering
Strategy are as follows:

+ Lv1 Left skill
+ Lv2 Left skill
+ Lv3 Left skill
+ Lv4 Left skill
+ Lv 5 left skill or right skill
